# Privacy Policy for Lookahead

**Last Updated:** January 17, 2026

## 1. Overview
Lookahead operates as a privacy-first utility for speedcubers. We believe your data belongs to you. This Privacy Policy explains how the Lookahead iOS application handles your information.

## 2. Data Collection & Storage
Lookahead is designed as a standalone, offline-first application.

*   **Solve Data & Statistics:** Your solve times, session history, and generated statistics are stored strictly **locally on your device** using Apple's Core Data framework. We do not transmit this data to any external server.
*   **App Preferences:** Settings such as themes, inspection timer toggle, and other user preferences are stored locally using `UserDefaults` (AppStorage).

## 3. No Account Required
You do not need to create an account, log in, or provide any personal identifiable information (PII) to use Lookahead.

## 4. Tracking & Analytics
Lookahead **does not** use any third-party analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase) or advertising networks. We do not track your usage behavior, location, or device identifiers.

## 5. Data Retention & Deletion
Because all data is stored on your device:
*   You retain full control over your data at all times.
*   Deleting the Lookahead app from your device will permanently delete all local history and settings associated with it.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Since the app does not collect user contact info, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes.
